golang-snipets-examples
=======================

Collection of snippets and examples for the Go language.

__To find the code you are looking for use the search box on top.__

I added this repository to keep a library of useful `Go` snippets as a reference for myself and others.

Additions or modifications to this reposity are welcome as long as they conform to the following guidelines:
- Keep the code simple. Use the simplest possible form that you can come up with.
- Use the minimum amount of imported modules (goes along with the first rule)
- Add generous amounts of comments.
- Explain everything that is not very obvious
- Add tags in the comments that help people find the code

__Thank you!__
